## Key Findings

Employees are broadly satisfied with their jobs and the mission.

Recognition, supervisor accountability, and social connections are major concerns.

Issues are organizational rather than isolated to certain departments.

## Recommendations

- Recognition Programs – peer-to-peer recognition, regular praise.

- Supervisor Accountability – leadership training, 360° feedback.

- Workplace Culture – mentorship programs, team-building initiatives.

- Monitoring & Transparency – repeat surveys, communicate results openly.
  

## Conclusion
The survey shows a workforce that is aligned with organizational goals but struggles with recognition, 
accountability, and connection. Addressing these gaps will improve morale, retention, and overall performance.
